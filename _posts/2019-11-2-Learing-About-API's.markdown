# Implementing API's
The Kahn Academy tutorial was very confusing and not very help full for me. I ended up having to do another tutorial so I could learn the jQuery techniques. Getting the API's to work was a little confusing since the json objects were different and it took me a minute to figure out that was why my script wasn't working. It was very exciting to get working because it opened a door to a large amount of possibilities with API's and jQuery scripts.
