# Implementing Long Haul
<img src="{{ '/assets/img/Killua.jpg' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt="">

Implementing long haul into my blogs was a struggle for me. I was new to using images that were within the blog folder. I was also new to all the different files that were separated to style and format the website. Having to change the styling in multiple files to change the appearance of the website was also new to me. Something that I still don't understand is how the picture automatically formats to fit the page and be slanted. I also still do not understand how all the pages automatically format to the long haul style.
