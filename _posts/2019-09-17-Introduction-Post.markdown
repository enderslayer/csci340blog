# My Experience With Jekyll

This is my first time ever creating a blog so this whole process was completely new to me. My biggest struggle was figuring out how to use the terminal to get ruby all set up. Thanks to [Dr. Goadrich](https://www.hendrix.edu/mathcs/goadrich/) I was able to figure out how to navigate to the correct directory. I am still unsure about how clicking the tabs and titles change the page to another designated page. I am looking forward to learning how to make the website interactive and how to link pages together. I also used this [link](https://gist.github.com/roachhd/779fa77e9b90fe945b0c) to learn the syntax for the Jekyll markdown.
