# Frameworks I am Interested In

My top three frameworks are frameworks that interest me and that use languages that I know to code in. This list is also in no order these are just the three that I feel would be best for my group.
1. Django
2. Flask
3. Express

# Django
Django is a Python based database framework. It is the most popular python based framework just barely ahead of Flask. Django has lots of built in features and is less customizable than Flask but also has a support system. They also have their own programs to view the databases with.
# Flask
Flask is also a Python based database framework. It is a very popular framework among developers but has less support videos and documentation. However it does have less features up front it is a highly customizable database with lots of available plugins available.
# Express
Express is a Java based database framework. It is the most popular java based framework. Java is the most used framework on the internet and is used in lots of large scale projects. I also like express because I know how to code in Java. Plus it also has lots of videos and programs to make getting around the databases easier.
